/**
 * @file earlyStreamKeepalive.ts
 * @description Early SSE keepalive wrapper so short idle-read clients stay connected
 * while the handler waits on upstream first-byte (reasoning models, combo failover).
 *
 * @changes
 * - [2026-07-28] [Cursor Grok 4.5] - Scrub omniroute from client-facing keepalive id/model/comment frames
 * - [2026-07-28] [Cursor Grok 4.5] - Neutralize Responses startup thinking text (no OmniRoute brand leak)
 *
 * Strict HTTP clients (notably Codex CLI's `reqwest`, which has a ~5s idle-read
 * timeout) drop the connection if no bytes arrive shortly after the request.
 * The proxy holds the streaming response until `ensureStreamReadiness` observes
 * the upstream's first useful byte — which can exceed 5s for reasoning models
 * that "think" before emitting any token (#2544). `curl` has no such idle
 * timeout, so it was never affected, which is why the bug looked client-specific.
 *
 * This wrapper keeps the connection warm without disturbing the handler's
 * internal logic (combo failover, stream readiness, account cooldown all still
 * run inside the handler before it resolves):
 *
 *   - Fast path: if the handler resolves within `thresholdMs`, its `Response`
 *     is returned verbatim — identical status, headers, and body. There is zero
 *     behavior change for normal latency, so metadata headers and non-200 error
 *     statuses are fully preserved for the common case.
 *
 *   - Slow path: if the handler is still pending after `thresholdMs`, a 200
 *     `text/event-stream` response is opened immediately and SSE comment
 *     heartbeats are emitted every `intervalMs` until the handler resolves; its
 *     body is then forwarded. If the handler ultimately fails, a structured
 *     `event: error` frame is emitted in-band (the response is already committed
 *     to 200, so the HTTP status can no longer change).
