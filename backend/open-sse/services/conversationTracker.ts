/**
 * Conversation Tracker — assigns a stable conversation id across separate
 * HTTP requests that are turns of the same multi-turn agentic conversation.
 *
 * Clients resend the full growing message/input history on every turn (no
 * server-side state dependency). Continuation is detected with a per-turn
 * hash chain (each turn's id = sha256(parentId, role, sha256(text)), the
 * same idea as a git commit graph): a new request's turns are walked from
 * the start against the candidate conversation's existing chain, matching as
 * far as they agree. Real agentic-CLI traffic (OpenClaw and similar) often
 * edits or duplicates a turn mid-history to keep provider-side prompt caches
 * warm — e.g. request 1 has turns `a b c … h i`, request 2 has
 * `a b c′ … h i′ i j k`. A whole-history hash (the original approach) breaks
 * on any such edit and never reconnects.
 *
 * Every OmniRoute conversation is a single straight line — it never forks.
 * When a turn diverges from what's already on file (`c` became `c'`), that
 * diverging history becomes its OWN independent conversation, with its own
 * id, built fresh from this request's full turn list — not a branch grafted
 * onto the old chain (2026-08-06 redesign; the branching model's real
 * traffic accumulated dozens of edits per session, and indenting one more
 * tree level per edit eventually left no room to show content at all).
 * `a b c d` and `a b c' d'` end up as two distinct conversations, sharing no
 * further storage after the point they diverge — simpler to store, query,
 * and render than a tree, and it matches how the data is actually used: a
 * "conversation" here is one continuous transcript, not a version-control
 * graph. This is a new, persisted mechanism — separate from
 * `sessionManager.ts`'s `generateSessionId()` (in-memory, routing/latency
 * only) even though it uses the same sha256-fingerprint style.

 * SQLite happened to list first — in practice the OLDEST, most stale one —
 * whose recorded next-turn almost never matches the current request, so the
 * walk stalled a few turns in and (worse) that stale anchor already has a

 * result: a real conversation minted a brand-new copy of its ENTIRE history
 * on every single request instead of ever reconnecting (2026-08-06). Every
 * candidate anchor for every prefix start is now tried, and the one that
 * verifiably extends furthest into the actual request wins — the only
 * reliable signal of genuine continuation when content repeats.
 *
 * #7847-class stall fix: the (start × anchor × walk) product over a long
 * duplicate-heavy history is bounded by a step budget (`maxSteps` /
 * `DEFAULT_RECONNECT_MAX_STEPS`), and turn content hashes are memoized via
 * `turnHashes` so each step hashes ~130 fixed-size bytes instead of re-hashing
 * the turn's full text. Budget exhaustion returns the best match verified so
 * far (possibly none) — degrading to "new conversation" downstream, never an
 * unverified attachment.
