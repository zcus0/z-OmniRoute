/**
 * Live wiring for STRICT_ZERO_COST's quota-based branch.
 *
 * Reuses the existing `getUsageForProvider()` (`open-sse/services/usage.ts`)
 * instead of building a second quota system — this module only adds a short
 * TTL cache in front of it (so a Telegram-scale request rate never triggers a
 * live billing-API call per candidate per request) and an invalidation hook
 * for the resilience layer to call the moment a 402/403/quota-exhausted
 * response is observed (`accountFallback.ts`).
 *
 * The cache is intentionally synchronous to read: `resolveFreeAccessState()`
 * never awaits. A cache miss returns `undefined` (→ UNKNOWN → excluded,
 * fail-closed) and kicks off a background refresh for the *next* read —
 * nothing here can make `strictZeroCostFilter.ts`'s pool build block on a
 * network call.
