/**
 * Shared authorization for the REST A2A task routes (GHSA-jcm5-6wpp-wjj8).
 *
 * Dual audience: the dashboard calls these routes with a management session,
 * A2A clients with an inference API key. Posture matrix:
 *
 *  - REQUIRE_API_KEY=true: a valid OmniRoute key is mandatory (the same
 *    posture the /v1 inference plane enforces); a management session also
 *    passes (dashboard), via alwaysRequireAuth so requireLogin=false cannot
 *    bypass it.
 *  - otherwise + requireLogin=true: management session, or a valid key.
 *  - otherwise + requireLogin=false (local-first default): open, by design.
 *
 * Callers authenticated by key are owner-scoped — another principal's tasks
 * answer as if they did not exist. Management/operator view sees all tasks.
