 *
 * When remote discovery fails, the models route falls back to the CACHED
 * catalog if it has one and only falls back to the local catalog when it does
 * not (`buildDiscoveryFallbackResponse`). A provider that was imported
 * successfully once therefore has a cache, so an expired key produced
 * `source: "cache"` + a warning and HTTP 200 — model-sync treated that as a
 * successful discovery, found every cached model already imported, and reported
 * "No new models were added" instead of the credential error. Retest, which
 * does not go through this path, failed correctly, which is what made the
 * import look like a real "nothing to do".
 *
 * The discriminator is the warning: the fallback builder always attaches one,
 * while the ordinary cache hit (`maybeReturnCachedDiscovery`, a non-refresh
 * read) attaches none. Model-sync always requests `refresh=true`, so the one
 * warning-carrying cache response it can observe is a degraded one.
