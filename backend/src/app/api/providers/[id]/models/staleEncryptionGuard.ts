/**
 * #6148 — Stale STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY guard for model-discovery.
 *
 * `decryptConnectionFields` (src/lib/db/encryption.ts) flags a connection with
 * `credentialDecryptFailed: true` when a stored credential is still encrypted
 * (`enc:v1:…`) but no longer decrypts — the signature of a changed or unset
 * STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY. Without this guard the null credential is coerced to
 * an empty string, an empty-Bearer request is sent upstream, and the operator
 * sees a misleading "Auth failed: 401" that hides the real cause.
 *
 * Returns a 424 (Failed Dependency) response with a clear, sanitized message
 * when the connection carries that flag; otherwise null (proceed normally).
