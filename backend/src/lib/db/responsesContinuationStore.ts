/**
 * responsesContinuationStore.ts — OmniRoute-native `previous_response_id`
 * virtualization for the OpenAI Responses API.
 *
 * Exposes `previous_response_id` continuation to clients unconditionally,
 * regardless of whether the actual upstream provider for a connection
 * supports Responses-API state at all: OmniRoute resolves the response id
 * back to the full input/output it produced and reconstructs the full
 * request server-side before forwarding upstream (full history, exactly as
 * today) -- the client only ever has to resend the new delta.
 *
 * Storage: reuses the existing call-log pipeline artifact (full, untruncated
 * request/response payloads, already gated by `call_log_pipeline_enabled`
 * and already retained/cleaned up by the existing call-log lifecycle)
 * instead of duplicating conversation content into a second store. Only a
 * lightweight `call_logs.response_id` index (154_call_logs_response_id.sql)
 * is new. Every lookup is scoped by `api_key_id` -- one client can never
 * resolve another client's stored conversation.
