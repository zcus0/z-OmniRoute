// Remove `changelog.d/` fragments whose bullet is ALREADY in CHANGELOG.md.
//
// WHY: the release reaches `main` as a single squash commit, so `main` still carries every
// fragment the reconciliation already folded in and deleted. The moment the release branch
// back-merges `main`, git faithfully restores all of them — 191 in the v3.8.49 run. Nothing
// is broken at that instant, which is the problem: the next aggregation folds them in a
// SECOND time and the section grows duplicate bullets that then have to be hand-unpicked.
//
// The rule is deliberately the simple one: a fragment is stale iff its content is already
// represented in CHANGELOG.md. Not "iff it belongs to an older version" — that needs the
// script to reason about which section owns it and gets the in-flight cycle wrong. Already
// present means redundant, wherever it is.
//
// Identity comes from the FILENAME (`<PR-number>-<slug>.md`), which is what that convention
// exists for, and NOT from the `#N` refs inside the bullet. Matching on any body ref looked
// right and was wrong — caught by running this against the live repo, where
// `changelog.d/features/8980-deprecate-gemini-cli-provider.md` was flagged stale because its
// bullet cites issue **#7034** for context, and #7034 shipped in an earlier cycle. That would
// have deleted an unreleased fragment and dropped its credit. A bullet routinely cites issues
// it merely references; only the filename says which PR the fragment *is*.
//
// Fragments with no number in the filename fall back to normalized text, and anything matching
// neither is always kept. Keeping a duplicate is a visible nuisance someone notices; deleting
// an unreleased bullet silently loses a contributor's credit — so every ambiguous case
// resolves toward keeping.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/release/sweep-stale-fragments.mjs            # report only
//   node scripts/release/sweep-stale-fragments.mjs --apply    # delete the stale ones
// Exit: 0 when nothing stale (or after a successful --apply), 1 when stale fragments remain
// in report mode — so the back-merge step can gate on it.
