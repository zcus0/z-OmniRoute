/**
 * tests/unit/local-redis-status.test.ts
 *
 * Coverage for src/app/api/local/redis/status/route.ts:
 *   - The status endpoint must report OmniRoute as "connected" whenever the
 *     native REDIS_URL is reachable — not only when a Docker/Podman container
 *     is present. This is the production path used by this instance
 *     (redis on 127.0.0.1:6379, no container).
 *
 * Verified at the source-contract level (the route imports Next.js + the route
 * guard, which is heavy to import in the native runner and would make the test
 * environment-dependent on a live container runtime).
