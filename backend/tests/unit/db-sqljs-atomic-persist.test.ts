// Regression guard: sql.js has no incremental write path, so every save rewrites
// the whole database image. When that write went through
// `fs.writeFileSync(filePath, …)`, the destination was opened with `O_TRUNC` —
// for the whole duration of the write the on-disk database was 0 bytes and then
// partial. Unlike better-sqlite3 / node:sqlite, that window is NOT covered by
// SQLite's locking protocol, so it was visible to every other process reading the
// same file (backup job, metrics exporter, an operator running `sqlite3`). Those
// readers got SQLITE_CORRUPT — "database disk image is malformed" — while
// `PRAGMA integrity_check` passed moments later, which made the failure look
// random and blamed the reader. The window scales with database size and recurs
// on every save.
//
// The fix writes to a temp file in the same directory and `rename()`s it over the
// destination. The property that distinguishes the two implementations, and the
// one asserted below, is inode identity: `rename` publishes a NEW inode, so a
// reader that already opened the file keeps reading a complete, coherent image,
// whereas `writeFileSync` mutates the inode the reader is holding.
//
// This is deliberately not a timing race — a sleep-based test would be flaky and
// would not prove anything about small databases that get written in one go.
