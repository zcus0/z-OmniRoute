/**
 * Regression guard — the dependency tree must resolve exactly ONE
 * `onnxruntime-node` (and one `onnxruntime-common`).
 *
 * `@huggingface/transformers` pins `onnxruntime-node` to an EXACT version
 * (4.2.0 → "1.24.3"). Whenever the root range in package.json drifts off that
 * pin, npm nests a second copy under
 * `node_modules/@huggingface/transformers/node_modules/onnxruntime-node`.
 *
 * Two copies cannot coexist in one Node process: both ship a native
 * `libonnxruntime.so.1` under the SAME SONAME, so glibc's loader binds
 * whichever was dlopen()ed first and the other addon dies with
 *
 *   Error: .../libonnxruntime.so.1: version `VERS_1.27.0' not found
 *          (required by .../onnxruntime_binding.node)
 *
 * That is exactly what a production-group dependabot bump did on 2026-08-16
 * (root `onnxruntime-node` "~1.24.3" → "~1.27.0"): it broke the Docker image
 * build at the Dockerfile's post-build standalone verification step, which
 * imports `@huggingface/transformers` and `onnxruntime-node` in one process.
 *
 * Keep the root range compatible with whatever `@huggingface/transformers`
 * pins — do not "fix" a future recurrence by copying the nested native
 * binaries into the bundle; the SONAME clash makes that impossible.
