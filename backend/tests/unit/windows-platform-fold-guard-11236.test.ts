/**
 * Structural regression guard for #11236 (Windows cliproxy residuals, bugs 2+3).
 *
 * Why this guard exists: the published npm artifact is bundled on Linux, and
 * the bundler constant-folds every literal `process.platform` read to the
 * BUILD machine's platform ("linux"), pruning the win32 branch from the
 * shipped artifact. Precedent: b43a212680 (#10244/#10293), which converted
 * detectPlatform/detectArch to runtime `os.platform()`/`os.arch()` reads for
 * exactly this reason. #10371 later fixed the Windows `.exe` binary name in
 * the source but left literal `process.platform` reads behind in the same
 * runtime paths, so the shipped artifact still:
 *   - named the managed binary `cliproxyapi` (no `.exe`) at install time
 *     (binaryManager.managedBinaryName), and
 *   - spawned that extension-less path at start time
 *     (installers/cliproxy.resolveSpawnArgs) -> ENOENT on Windows even with a
 *     valid `.exe` in place (issue #11236 bugs 2 and 3).
 *
 * The runtime-safe pattern is a call-time `os.platform()` read. This guard
 * fails if `process.platform` reappears outside a comment in any file whose
 * platform branch feeds the published artifact's runtime behavior (binary
 * name, spawn path, per-OS probe selection).
