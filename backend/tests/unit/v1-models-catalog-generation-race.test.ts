// Regression guard — catalog in-flight build survived invalidation and repopulated
// the cache with pre-write state (generation race).
//
// catalogCache coalesces concurrent GET /v1/models onto one in-flight builder and
// drops completed entries when invalidateDbCache() bumps modelCatalogCacheVersion.
// But the in-flight map was keyed only by request shape: a build that STARTED before
// a write could still be JOINED by a request that arrived after it, and when the
// stale build finished it called storePayload unconditionally — repopulating the
// now-current cache with a body built from pre-write DB state.
//
// Fix: every in-flight build is bound to the catalog-state generation it started
// from. New requests only join a current-generation build, and storePayload only
// persists a payload whose build generation still equals the live version. A stale
// build still resolves to its own original caller (that request is legitimately
// waiting on it) but never overwrites the fresh cache.
//
// These tests drive resolveCachedCatalogResponse directly with a deferred builder so
// the interleaving is fully deterministic — no sleeps, no real-time races.
