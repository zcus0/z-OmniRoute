// #11295 — the learned clamp (reactive, from upstream 4xx) and the declared
// clamp (static registry `supportedThinkingEfforts`) used to disagree on
// direction for the identical accepted set {low,high,max}: the learned path
// was downgrade-only (medium -> low) while the declared path was already
// nearest-tier (medium -> high). Same inputs, opposite outputs, depending only
// on whether the model happened to have a static registry entry. This test
// proves the two paths now agree, and that a request below the learned floor
// (previously silently passed through unmapped, returning null from
// clampToLearned) is now mapped up to the nearest accepted tier instead.
