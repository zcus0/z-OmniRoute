// ENVIRONMENT NOTE (sandbox better-sqlite3 / glibc limitation, not a code defect):
// This test constructs or exercises a real better-sqlite3-backed SQLite database.
// better-sqlite3 is a native addon; production and CI load it normally, but some
// sandboxes/dev boxes ship a system glibc older than the prebuilt binary requires
// ("GLIBC_2.29 not found"), so the native module fails to dlopen and any test that
// reaches better-sqlite3 directly (or asserts stdout that the load-failure warning
// would pollute) fails HERE while passing in CI. This is a known environment
// limitation, not a defect in the code under test: the OmniRoute runtime itself
// cascades to node:sqlite/sql.js when better-sqlite3 is unavailable. See
// tests/unit/_helpers/betterSqlite3Availability.ts for a guard helper.

/**
 * Regression coverage: `omniroute --mcp` (the stdio transport Claude Desktop and other MCP
 * clients spawn) must write nothing but JSON-RPC to stdout. DB init — a side effect of
 * `createMcpServer()`'s tool registration reading compression settings — used to log via
 * plain `console.log` before any redirect was in place (ES module static imports are hoisted
 * and evaluate before any code inside the importing module's own functions runs, so a
 * redirect placed inside server.ts itself was too late). That leaked lines like
 * "[DB] Changing cache_size from 65536KB to 16384KB" straight onto stdout, corrupting the
 * JSON-RPC stream client-side (e.g. Claude Desktop: `Unexpected token 'D', "[DB] Changi"...
 * is not valid JSON`). Fixed by preloading bin/mcpStdioConsoleGuard.mjs via `node --import`
 * (bin/mcp-server.mjs) — the only point early enough to run before the MCP entry's module
 * graph evaluates at all.
