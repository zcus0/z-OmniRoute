/**
 * STRICT_ZERO_COST — autodiscovery contract (Fase 5-8 of the design audit):
 * the filter must never hardcode a provider/model allowlist. It reads
 * whatever `catalog` (FREE_MODEL_BUDGETS-shaped) it's given, so a new SAFE
 * entry becomes usable the moment it appears, and a removed one disappears
 * the moment it's gone — no code change, no KITT change.
 *
 * Uses `evaluateCandidateConnections`'s injectable `catalog` argument (added
 * for exactly this test) with synthetic fixtures instead of mutating the
 * real, shared `FREE_MODEL_BUDGETS` — that constant is imported by
 * production code and other test files; mutating it at runtime would be a
 * global side effect this file has no business causing.
