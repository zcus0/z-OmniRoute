// tests/unit/build/should-promote-latest-5301.test.ts
// Regression guard for #5301 — Docker Hub `:latest` tag not re-pointed on release.
//
// The docker-publish workflow decides whether the just-built VERSION should also
// move `:latest` by extracting the highest STABLE semver from the candidate set.
// The bug: on a `release: released` event the freshly-created git tag is often
// not yet visible to `git fetch --tags`, so a candidate set built purely from
// `git tag -l` resolved HIGHEST to the *previous* version and skipped promotion,
// leaving `latest` one release behind. The fix folds VERSION into the candidate
// set so the decision is independent of tag-sync timing.
//
// Strategy: spawn the real extracted helper (scripts/ci/should-promote-latest.sh)
// with fixture tag lists on stdin — this guards the actual shell code the
// workflow calls, not a parallel reimplementation. Hermetic: no git, no network.

/**
 * Run the helper with `version` as argv[1] and `tags` (joined by \n) on stdin.
 *
 * stdin is a real FILE, not a pipe, and that is the whole point. The script
 * short-circuits a pre-release VERSION and `exit 0`s WITHOUT ever reading stdin:
 *
 *     case "$VERSION" in
 *       *-*) echo "false"; exit 0 ;;
 *     esac
 *
 * Feeding it through `input:` makes the parent write to a pipe whose reader has
 * already gone away, so the write raises `spawnSync bash EPIPE` — the test throws
 * before it can assert anything. It is a race, not load: whether the write lands
 * before the child exits depends on the 64 KB pipe buffer and the scheduler, which
 * is why it failed intermittently in CI (#8953, #8966) while passing locally.
 * Measured deterministically:
 *
 *          2 tags (     11 bytes) → ok
 *        100 tags (    689 bytes) → ok
 *      5 000 tags ( 43 889 bytes) → ok
 *     20 000 tags (188 889 bytes) → EPIPE, every time
 *
 * A regular file has no reader to lose, so the child may exit whenever it likes.
 * The script's interface is unchanged — it still reads candidate tags from stdin,
 * exactly as docker-publish.yml pipes them in.
