/**
 * #10427 — the packaged artifact carries `dist/BUILD_SHA`, but nothing ever checked that
 * the SHA belongs to the release line. A tarball built from a feature branch installs and
 * runs indistinguishably from a release build.
 *
 * That is exactly how the internal gateway ended up serving a build from
 * `fix/9603-qwen-token-plan-quota` (SHA 178febc50f) that predated #10373: every request
 * died with `502 … Executor result must contain a Response`, and the only way to find out
 * what was actually deployed was SSH + grepping the compiled chunks.
 *
 * Two defenses, both covered here:
 *  - `resolveBuildProvenance()` classifies a build SHA against the release line.
 *  - the health payload exposes `buildSha`, so what is deployed is auditable over HTTP.
