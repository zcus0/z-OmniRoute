/**
 * `npm install -g <tarball>` on the .17 gateway finishes writing the package and then fails
 * while renaming the old tree into its staging directory:
 *
 *   npm error code ENOTEMPTY
 *   npm error syscall rename
 *   npm error path /usr/lib/node_modules/omniroute
 *   npm error dest /usr/lib/node_modules/.omniroute-h797OOZa
 *
 * Exit status is 217, but `dist/BUILD_SHA`, the package version and every dependency are the
 * new ones. The canary treated the non-zero exit as "install failed", aborted before the
 * restart, and discarded npm's stderr — so the deploy stopped half-done twice (2026-08-18)
 * with no clue in the log about why.
 *
 * The exit code is not the source of truth here; the SHA on disk is. These cases pin that,
 * including the inverse trap: a ZERO exit that installed the wrong artifact must still fail.
