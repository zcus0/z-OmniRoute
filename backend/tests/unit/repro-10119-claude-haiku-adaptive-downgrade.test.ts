// Issue #10119: a request that already carries `thinking:{type:"adaptive"}` (the shape
// OmniRoute builds for an adaptive-only sibling like Opus 4.7+/Sonnet-5 in a combo) is
// forwarded verbatim when combo/fallback routing re-targets the SAME request to a model
// that only supports manual extended thinking (e.g. claude-haiku-4-5-20251001). Anthropic
// rejects `type:"adaptive"` on Haiku with "adaptive thinking is not supported on this
// model". The translator must downgrade `adaptive` -> `enabled` (with a safe budget) for
// any non-`isAdaptiveThinkingOnly` Claude model instead of forwarding an incompatible type.
