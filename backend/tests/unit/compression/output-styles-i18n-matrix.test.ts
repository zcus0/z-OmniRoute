/**
 * Guard for the output-style × language matrix.
 *
 * Why this exists: the compression INPUT engines understand 10 languages (rule
 * packs under open-sse/services/compression/rules/ + the detector), but the
 * OUTPUT styles only instruct in a subset. `less-code` shipped English-only and
 * nobody noticed for months, because every other test is per-style. This test
 * is per-MATRIX: it pins the expected coverage so a new style cannot silently
 * be born English-only, and so an existing style cannot silently lose a locale.
 *
 * Adding a language to a style: extend BASELINE_LANGUAGES below (the assertion
 * is "at least these", so growth never fails the gate).
 * Adding a NEW style: it must cover REQUIRED_LANGUAGES, or be listed in
 * KNOWN_ENGLISH_ONLY with a tracking issue.
