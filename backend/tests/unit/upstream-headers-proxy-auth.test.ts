// `FORBIDDEN` in src/shared/constants/upstreamHeaders.ts is documented as the
// hop-by-hop / Host / framing denylist, and it was missing two of the RFC 7230
// §6.1 names. Measured before the fix:
//
//   proxy-authorization   upstream=allow  custom=allow
//   proxy-authenticate    upstream=allow  custom=allow
//   proxy-connection      upstream=BLOCK  custom=BLOCK
//
// `proxy-authorization` is the one that costs something: it authenticates the
// hop to the operator's own proxy, so forwarding it hands that credential to
// the model provider. Five other modules in this repo already strip it
// (reverseProxy HOP_BY_HOP, mitm/sanitizeHeaders, inspector/httpProxyServer,
// tproxy/tlsCapture, openapi/try) — the canonical list did not.
