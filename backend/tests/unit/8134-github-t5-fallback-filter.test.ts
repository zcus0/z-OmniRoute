// Regression for #8134 — GitHub Copilot ("github", alias "gh") T5 family fallback
// returned "claude-opus-4-6" verbatim even though the github registry catalog at
// the time (Opus 4.8 / 4.8-fast / 4.7 / 4.5) had NO 4.6 tier under any dot/hyphen
// notation. getNextFamilyFallback() resolved `supportedIds` from the provider's
// registry but only used it to try notation variants of a candidate, never to
// filter out a candidate that is provably absent from the catalog — so the
// unsupported id fell through and was returned anyway, costing a 3rd wasted
// upstream round-trip before the family was exhausted.
//
// Fix: when the provider registry is resolved, getNextFamilyFallback() now
// skips (continue) any family candidate that has no match in supportedIds
// under ANY notation (hyphen, dot, or a dated-snapshot id with the date
// suffix stripped) instead of returning it unfiltered.
//
// Fixture note: #10952 later added claude-opus-4.6 to the github registry, so
// the provably-absent tier used by the fixture moved to claude-opus-4-6-thinking
// (the ladder's first candidate after 4.6 — still absent from the catalog).
