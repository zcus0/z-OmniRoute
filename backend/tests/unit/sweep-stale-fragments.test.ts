/**
 * Guard for the back-merge fragment sweep.
 *
 * The release reaches `main` as one squash commit, so `main` still holds every `changelog.d/`
 * fragment the reconciliation folded in and deleted. When the release branch back-merges
 * `main`, git restores all of them — 191 in the v3.8.49 run. Nothing looks broken at that
 * moment, which is exactly why it bites: the NEXT aggregation folds them in a second time and
 * the section grows duplicates that have to be hand-unpicked.
 *
 * The asymmetry these tests pin matters more than the happy path. Keeping a duplicate is a
 * visible nuisance someone will notice. Deleting a fragment that never shipped silently drops
 * a contributor's credit. So every ambiguous case must resolve to KEEP.

## [Unreleased]

## [3.8.49] - 2026-07-30

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **fix(sse):** stop the retry loop double-counting attempts ([#8100](https://github.com/x/y/pull/8100)) — thanks @someone
- **fix(db):** migration 109 is idempotent again ([#8101](https://github.com/x/y/pull/8101))

### 📝 Maintenance

- **chore(ci):** pin the workflow action digests, no issue number on this one
