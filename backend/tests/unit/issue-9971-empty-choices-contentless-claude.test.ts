/**
 * #9971 — Non-stream MALFORMED-200/empty_choices false positive on `cc/` routes.
 *
 * A content-less-but-valid Claude body — thinking-only (with no visible text AND
 * no signature), redacted_thinking-only, or a truncated extended-thinking-only
 * stream cut before any text/signature landed — must be treated as VALID output,
 * not flagged as `empty_choices` (which became a false 502 / BAD_GATEWAY).
 *
 * Root cause (plan-file): the Claude Code OAuth subscription upstream can truncate
 * long large-input+large-output generations around the ~3-min turn boundary; the
 * non-stream path's `detectMalformedNonStream` then misclassified the resulting
 * content-less/thinking-only Claude body as `empty_choices`. The guard may only
 * fire for a genuinely malformed upstream response — a non-200 or a truly empty
 * *terminal* completion (terminal stop_reason with no usable output).
 *
 * Live note: the exact large-recvBytes+empty signature (33–65KB) needs a live VPS
 * capture to confirm the upstream truncation; this test encodes the
 * offline-reproducible mechanism (content-less thinking/redacted bodies), which
 * failed to `empty_choices` on the unfixed code and must pass after the fix.
