// #10268: "[BUG] API call failed (attempt 1/3): InternalServerError [HTTP 503]" — Hermes
// Agent / Cursor coding-agent fan-out landed on the same structural admission gate as
// #10183 and burned its 3 retries on OmniRoute's own `chat_admission_busy` 503, which it
// misread as an upstream capacity error. Same root cause, same fix (heap-conditional
// shedding in `admitChatStructure`): this test is the permanent regression guard proving
// the exact reported 503 shape is still produced when heap pressure is GENUINELY high,
// so the #4380 heap-amplification shed path is preserved rather than removed outright.
