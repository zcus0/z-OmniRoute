/**
 * Regression guard for the broken Turbopack production build on release/v3.8.50.
 *
 * Six independent module-level defects, each from a different PR, made `npm run build`
 * fail. Most are *link-time* errors, so those cases are expressed as "this module must be
 * importable / statically resolvable" rather than as behavioral assertions:
 *
 *  1. src/shared/components/modelSelectModalHelpers.ts — a lost `}` (#9011) left
 *     `export const PROVIDER_TEST_CHUNK_SIZE` inside a function body.
 *  2. open-sse/handlers/videoGeneration.ts — `handleFalVideoGeneration` imported
 *     twice from two different modules (#9982 landed on top of #9969).
 *  3. src/app/api/v1/models/catalog.ts — re-exported three SWR symbols that #9199
 *     deliberately removed from ./catalogCache when it replaced #8728's injectable
 *     policy with a fixed 30 s bound. The consumer was never updated.
 *  4. src/app/api/v1/models/catalogCache.ts — the same PR left two dangling statements
 *     referencing undeclared `inFlight` / `promise`, so every stale-while-revalidate
 *     read threw a ReferenceError at RUNTIME (this one the build never caught).
 *  5. open-sse/executors/tinycmsSigner.ts — generated wasm-bindgen glue kept a
 *     `new URL('wasm_signer_bg.wasm', import.meta.url)` default that no file backs.
 *  6. src/app/api/providers/[id]/models/conolDiscovery.ts — imported
 *     `getProviderOutboundGuard` from ./outboundUrlGuard, which does not export it (#8974).
