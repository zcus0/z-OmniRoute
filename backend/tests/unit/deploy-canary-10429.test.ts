/**
 * #10429 — deploying the internal gateway was a manual sequence (build, pack, scp,
 * `npm i -g`, `pm2 restart`) with no record of what landed and no proof it served traffic.
 *
 * On 2026-08-14 that produced a silent outage: the installed package was built from a
 * feature branch predating #10373, so every request returned
 * `502 … Executor result must contain a Response`. A health check would NOT have caught
 * it — the process was up and `/api/monitoring/health` answered `healthy`; only a real
 * completion exercised the broken egress path.
 *
 * The planner below is pure (every side effect injected) so the policy — refuse
 * unverifiable artifacts, verify with a real completion, roll back on failure — is
 * testable without touching a host.
