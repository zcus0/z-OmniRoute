/**
 * G0 guard — the PR→release/** rail (quality.yml) must keep the ratchet + security
 * gates that used to run only on the PR→main rail (ci.yml).
 *
 * Why: the god-file refactor (trilho 3.8.50→3.9.0) happens almost entirely in
 * PRs targeting release/**. Before G0, those PRs skipped the CodeQL ratchet, the
 * quality-ratchet engine, and every security scanner — exactly the net the
 * refactor needs. Five of the 13 root causes reconciled on 2026-07-24 were real
 * production regressions shipped through green per-PR CI; the gates below are the
 * part of that lesson that can be enforced by machine.
 *
 * This test pins MEMBERSHIP, not order: removing a gate from quality.yml (or
 * moving it to a job that does not run on code PRs) must be a conscious decision
 * that edits this file in the same PR, with the reason in the diff.
