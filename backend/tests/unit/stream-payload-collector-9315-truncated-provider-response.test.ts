/**
 * #9315 — Dashboard log viewer shows stale provider response for long streamed responses.
 *
 * Root cause: buildStreamSummaryFromEvents(providerPayloadCollector.getEvents(), ...)
 * reconstructs the provider payload from captured SSE events. The StructuredSSECollector
 * is head-retaining/tail-dropping with default caps (maxEvents=200/maxBytes=49152).
 * When a stream exceeds these caps, late events — final content, reasoning, tool_calls,
 * finish_reason — are silently dropped, so the "Provider Response" panel in the dashboard
 * shows stale/incomplete data.
 *
 * The fix: pass the accumulated responseBody directly to providerPayloadCollector.build()
 * instead of buildStreamSummaryFromEvents(), matching what the client path already does.
 * This regression test proves the truncation and validates the fix path.
