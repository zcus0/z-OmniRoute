/**
 * tests/unit/routing-events-concurrency.test.ts
 *
 * Stress the routing-event system (Phase 4):
 *  - thousands of events through the real dispatch + quality + memory sinks
 *  - ring-buffer boundedness under sustained load (newest retained)
 *  - a throwing sink under load is isolated (other sinks keep working)
 *  - quality tracker updates stay consistent under interleaved async bursts
 *  - simultaneous reset() during inserts does not throw or corrupt state
 *
 * Node's event loop is single-threaded, so "concurrency" here is interleaved
 * async execution; these tests assert correctness under bursts, not true
 * parallelism.
