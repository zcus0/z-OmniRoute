// Probe for issue #10274 -- "Search providers (tavily/exa/firecrawl) leak API keys to
// api.openai.com when used as chat/combo targets".
//
// Search-only providers (tavily-search, exa-search, firecrawl, serper-search, ...) exist
// ONLY in SEARCH_PROVIDERS (open-sse/config/searchRegistry.ts) + the /v1/search catalog;
// they have no chat REGISTRY entry and no specialized executor. Routing one of them as a
// chat-completions target (e.g. a round-robin combo with targets "tavily-search/web")
// therefore fell through to DefaultExecutor's `PROVIDERS[provider] || PROVIDERS.openai`
// fallback, which forwarded the user's real search API key to https://api.openai.com
// (observed as `[401] Incorrect API key provided: tvly-...` from OpenAI, not from Tavily).
// This probe proves the executor-level root cause directly and pins the guard: getExecutor()
// must throw a clear, sanitized 400 for every search provider instead of silently inheriting
// OpenAI's base URL/config. The guard set is DERIVED from SEARCH_PROVIDERS so adding a new
// search provider without updating the guard fails this test.
