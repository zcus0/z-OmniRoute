/**
 * Regression tests for #9318: OpenCode Zen DeepSeek models should accept `max`
 * reasoning effort (not normalized to `xhigh`).
 *
 * OpenCode Zen proxies DeepSeek with the native DeepSeek API contract, which
 * accepts {high, max} literally — same as opencode-go. Without this opt-in,
 * `max` would be normalized to `xhigh` and rejected by the upstream.
