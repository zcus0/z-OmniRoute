/**
 * next-version-pinned.test.ts — `next` must be pinned to an exact version.
 *
 * The published package ships a PREBUILT `.next` directory. That build output is
 * tightly coupled to the exact Next.js runtime that produced it: `next start`
 * reads build manifests whose shape changes between minors. With a caret range,
 * `npm i -g omniroute` resolves whatever Next is latest at INSTALL time, so a
 * fresh upstream release silently breaks every new install even though nothing
 * in this repo changed.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical: Next 16.3.1 (published 2026-08-13T22:45Z) added
 * `validationLevel` to its server config schema, and a `.next` built by 16.2.12
 * crashes at boot with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading
 * 'validationLevel')" — the symbol has 0 occurrences in 16.2.12 and 74 in
 * 16.3.1. Range `^16.2.11` picked it up on the VPS install (2026-08-14).
 *
 * `react`/`react-dom` are already pinned exactly for the same reason; this test
 * extends that invariant to `next` and keeps package.json in sync with the
 * lockfile version the build actually uses.
