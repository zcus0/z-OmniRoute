/**
 * A 402 from a PAID OpenRouter model locks the whole connection as
 * "credits_exhausted" (openrouter-quota-6842.test.ts confirms this is
 * intentional connection-scoped behavior for OpenRouter's shared account
 * balance). But OpenRouter's `:free` models are not gated by that same
 * balance, so once one paid-model call trips the lock, every `:free` model
 * combo target on that same connection is also skipped for the full 1h
 * cooldown — even though the free models never touched the exhausted
 * credits. This defeats combo failover to free models, which is the whole
 * point of configuring them.
 *
 * getProviderCredentials must keep serving `:free` model requests from a
 * connection whose ONLY problem is credits_exhausted, while still refusing
 * paid-model requests (and still refusing free-model requests on a
 * connection that's terminal for another reason, e.g. banned).
