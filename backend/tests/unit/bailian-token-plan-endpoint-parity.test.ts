/**
 * bailian-coding-plan ("Alibaba Token Plan") pointed inference and validation at two
 * DIFFERENT hosts.
 *
 * #10290 moved the open-sse registry to the Token Plan host, but the dashboard's key
 * validation resolves its URL through ALIBABA_PROVIDER_REGION_ENDPOINTS, which still held
 * the legacy Coding Plan host. Verified live 2026-08-18 with a valid Token Plan key:
 *
 *   coding-intl.dashscope.aliyuncs.com   → 401 invalid_api_key
 *   token-plan.ap-southeast-1.maas...    → 429 Throttling.AllocationQuota (auth OK)
 *
 * validateBailianCodingPlanProvider maps 401/403 to "Invalid API key", so a perfectly
 * good key was rejected at add-connection time while the very same key worked for
 * inference. These tests pin the two paths together.
