// #3578 — `omniroute --mcp` crashed on npm installs with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for
// src/lib/combos/steps.ts: the MCP server runs from raw TypeScript source and imports
// across src/ + open-sse/, but the published `files` allowlist only shipped a few
// cherry-picked paths. This gate computes the MCP server's transitive import closure
// and asserts every reachable src/ + open-sse/ file is covered by a package.json
// `files` entry, so a missing dir can never silently ship a broken --mcp again.
//
// Live `npm pack` over-inclusion checks (#3821) live in
// `scripts/build/validate-pack-artifact.ts` (already `--ignore-scripts`) so concurrent
// `test:unit` never stalls on a monorepo pack walk / prepare→husky lifecycle.
