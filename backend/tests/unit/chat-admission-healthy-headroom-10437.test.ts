// #10437: the #10183/#10268 fix admitted a busy heavyweight request immediately
// whenever the heap was healthy, via an unconditional no-op lease — with no bound
// of its own. That let an UNLIMITED number of "healthy heap" requests pile in ahead
// of the heap-pressure shed path, defeating the purpose of admission control: a
// slow leak (or a burst that never quite trips the heap-pressure ratio) could still
// starve the process. This is the permanent regression guard proving the
// healthy-heap fast path now has a real, finite ceiling (`healthyHeadroom`) and
// falls through to the SAME bounded-wait/shed path used under real heap pressure
// once that budget is exhausted — the existing #10183/#10268 heap-pressure gate is
// preserved unchanged; only the previously-unbounded healthy path is now bounded.
