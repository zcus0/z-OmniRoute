// Shared guard for unit tests that construct a real better-sqlite3 Database as a
// test fixture (e.g. seeding a legacy on-disk schema before exercising the
// migration runner). better-sqlite3 is a native addon: production and CI load
// it fine, but some sandboxes/dev boxes ship a system glibc older than the
// prebuilt binary requires (e.g. "GLIBC_2.29 not found"), so `new Database(...)`
// throws ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED at fixture-construction time. That is an environment
// limitation, NOT a defect in the code under test — the OmniRoute runtime itself
// cascades to node:sqlite/sql.js when better-sqlite3 can't load, so the app keeps
// working; only tests that reach for better-sqlite3 DIRECTLY (to build a
// driver-specific fixture) are affected.
//
// Tests import `betterSqlite3Available` to decide whether to run or to skip with
// a clear, documented reason. In CI (where better-sqlite3 loads) the tests run
// normally; only the constrained sandbox skips them.
//
// Usage:
//   import { betterSqlite3Available, BETTER_SQLITE3_SKIP_REASON } from "./_helpers/betterSqlite3Availability";
//   const canUseBetterSqlite3 = betterSqlite3Available();
//   test("...", { skip: canUseBetterSqlite3 ? false : BETTER_SQLITE3_SKIP_REASON }, () => { ... });
