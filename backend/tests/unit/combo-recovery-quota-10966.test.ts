// tests/unit/combo-recovery-quota-10966.test.ts
// #10966: a combo that exhausts because every observed failure was a durable
// quota/balance error (HTTP 403 `insufficient_quota` / `AUTHZ_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`,
// or the more common 402/429 quota signals) must NOT ship `recovery.action = "retry"`.
//
// Root cause chain (both pieces exercised here against the REAL exported functions,
// not re-implemented logic):
//
//  1. open-sse/services/combo/quotaExhaustion.ts::isQuotaExhaustionResponse only
//     classified status 402/429 as quota-exhaustion; a 403 insufficient_quota /
//     AUTHZ_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE response (the issue's exact repro) fell straight
//     through to `false`, so combo.ts's `allObservedFailuresQuota` accumulator
//     never went (and stayed) true for this class of failure.
//  2. open-sse/services/combo/pinRecovery.ts::buildRecoveryHint had no case for a
//     stable "quota_exhausted" terminalReason, so even a caller that DID resolve
//     the reason correctly fell through to the `default` "retry" / "failed
//     transiently" branch — actively wrong advice for a durable wallet exhaustion.
