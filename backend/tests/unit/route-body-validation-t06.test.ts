/**
 * Guard for the t06:route-validation gate (Hard Rule #7 — always validate inputs
 * with Zod schemas).
 *
 * The gate (scripts/check/check-route-validation.mjs) is a source scan: any
 * `route.ts` under src/app/api that calls `request.json()` must also call
 * `validateBody()` or `.safeParse()`. It has NO allowlist, so a route that
 * hand-rolls `typeof x === "string"` checks passes review but fails CI — which
 * is exactly how four routes (#9445 marketplace install, #8523's three Dario
 * admin routes) landed on release/v3.8.50 and kept the branch out of
 * release-green (#9737).
 *
 * This test runs the same rule inside the unit suite so the violation surfaces
 * on the PR that introduces it, instead of on the next base-red sweep.
