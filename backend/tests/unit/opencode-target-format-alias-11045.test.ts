// oc/muse-spark-1.2-contributor-free returns HTTP 400 with an empty assistant
// message right after `targetFormat:"openai-responses"` was added to its registry
// entry (#10874). Root cause: `PROVIDER_MODELS` is keyed by the provider's public
// ALIAS ("oc"), not its raw registry id ("opencode") — resolving the target format
// with the raw id missed the registry entry entirely, so `buildUrl()` kept picking
// `/chat/completions` while chatCore's own (correctly aliased) request translation
// had already switched the request BODY to the Responses API shape (`input:[...]`).
// Upstream received a Responses-shaped body at the Chat Completions endpoint and
// returned a degenerate empty response.
