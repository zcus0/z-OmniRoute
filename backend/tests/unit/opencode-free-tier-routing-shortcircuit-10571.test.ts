/**
 * Regression test for PR #10571 — bare "big-pickle" / "*-free" model ids must
 * keep routing to an opencode-family provider (opencode / opencode-zen) when
 * an opencode connection is active, even if the live-synced catalog for that
 * connection is temporarily stale/incomplete and would otherwise exclude it
 * during the normal live-catalog reconciliation step.
 *
 * This also regression-guards a bug found while writing this test: the
 * short-circuit as originally shipped checked `activeProviders?.has("opencode")`
 * literally. `getActiveProviderSet()` canonicalizes every connection's
 * provider id through `resolveProviderAlias()`, and a manual override in
 * `open-sse/services/model.ts` (`ALIAS_TO_PROVIDER_ID["opencode"] =
 * "opencode-zen"`) rewrites any "opencode" id to "opencode-zen" before it
 * ever reaches the active set — so a real active no-auth "opencode"
 * connection NEVER appears as "opencode" in `activeProviders`, making the
 * literal check unreachable. The fix checks every opencode-family candidate
 * (`opencode` and `opencode-zen`) that actually catalogs the model id.
 *
 * Without the short-circuit (or with the original unreachable literal
 * check), an active opencode connection + active opencode-zen connection
 * both carrying a synced catalog that omits "big-pickle" makes
 * `getModelInfoCore("big-pickle", null)` return
 * `{ provider: null, errorType: "model_not_found" }` instead of routing to
 * opencode — this test proves the short-circuit prevents exactly that.
