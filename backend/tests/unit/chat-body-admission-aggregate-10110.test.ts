// #10110: Aggregate process-wide bounds for byte-level chat admission.
//
// The always-on per-connection admission layer (#9940 / #9654) enforces
// CHAT_MAX_HEAVY_IN_FLIGHT and CHAT_ADMISSION_MAX_QUEUED_BYTES PER LANE, so the
// documented "in one process" contract (docs/reference/ENVIRONMENT.md:193) is
// multiplied by OMNIROUTE_CHAT_VIRTUAL_MAX_SESSIONS (default 64): up to 64
// concurrent heavy requests and 256 MiB of parked bodies process-wide.
//
// These tests assert the AGGREGATE contract that the issue's acceptance
// criteria demand. They are intentionally deterministic (exact === assertions,
// no <= fudge) and are RED on release/v3.8.50 — they only pass once the byte
// level admits against one process-global budget with per-key fairness.
