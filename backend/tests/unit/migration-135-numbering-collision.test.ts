/**
 * Regression test for a migration version-numbering collision: two files,
 * 135_connection_runtime_state.sql (#9449, landed 2026-08-07) and
 * 135_migrate_model_capability_max_token.sql (#8908, landed 2026-08-05),
 * both claimed version "135" — #9449 branched before #8908 merged and never
 * got renumbered before landing on release/v3.8.50.
 *
 * This is not a cosmetic issue: `getMigrationFiles()` throws
 * "Migration version collision detected" the moment ANY code path first
 * touches the database (getDbInstance() -> runMigrations()), which means a
 * completely fresh install/deploy from this branch cannot even boot —
 * confirmed live against a freshly built container.
 *
 * Fix: renumbered the later-landing file to 140 (the next free slot) and
 * added the matching isSchemaAlreadyApplied("140") retroactive guard
 * (migrationRunner.ts), matching the established pattern already used for
 * the prior 135/136 -> 137/138 renumber in the same file.
